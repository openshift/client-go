OpenShift v3 Diagnostics

This is a tool to help administrators and users resolve common problems
that occur with OpenShift v3 deployments. It will likely remain
under continuous development as the OpenShift Origin project progresses.

The goals of the diagnostics tool are summarized in the Trello card
https://trello.com/c/LdUogKuN; Diagnostics are included as an `openshift`
sub-command that analyzes OpenShift as it is able, whether from the
perspective of an OpenShift client or on an OpenShift host.

View pkg/diagnostics/README.md for more details on developing
diagnostics.
