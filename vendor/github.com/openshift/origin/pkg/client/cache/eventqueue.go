// EventQueue is a Store implementation that provides a sequence of compressed events to a consumer
// along with event types.  This differs from the FIFO implementation in that FIFO does not provide
// events when an object is deleted and does not provide the type of event.  Events are compressed
// in a manner similar to FIFO, but accounting for event types and deletions.  The exact
// compression semantics are as follows:
//
// 1.  If a watch.Added is enqueued with state X and a watch.Modified with state Y is received,
//     these are compressed into (Added, Y)
//
// 2.  If a watch.Added is enqueued with state X and a watch.Deleted is received, these are
//     compressed and the item is removed from the queue
//
// 3.  If a watch.Modified is enqueued with state X and a watch.Modified with state Y is received,
//     these two events are compressed into (Modified, Y)
//
// 4.  If a watch.Modified is enqueued with state X and a watch.Deleted is received, these are
//     compressed into (Deleted, X)
//
// It should be noted that the scenario where an object is deleted and re-added is not handled by
// this type nor is it in scope; the reflector uses UIDs for the IDs passed to stores, so you will
// never see a delete and a re-add for the same ID.
//
// This type maintains a backing store in order to provide the deleted state on watch.Deleted
// events.  This is necessary because the Store API does not receive the deleted state on a
// watch.Deleted event (though this state is delivered by the watch API itself, it is not passed on
// to the reflector Store).
