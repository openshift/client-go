OpenShift 3: Project Quota and Resource Limits
========================================
This example will demonstrate how quota and resource limits can be applied to resources in a project.

This example assumes you have completed the sample-app example, and have a functional OpenShift setup.

Resources
-----------------------------------------
By default, a pod in your project runs with unbounded CPU and memory constraints.  This means that
any pod in the system will be able to consume as much CPU and memory on the node that runs the pod.

An author of a pod may set explicit resource limits per container in the pod in order to control
memory usage dedicated to its containers on a node.

The following is an example of a pod that has a single container.  This container sets its resource
limit for cpu to 100m and memory as 6Mi.  This means that the container will get 100 millicores of
a core on the Node.  In effect, if the node had a single core, this pod could be scheduled 10 times
at most to a single host.

```shell
$ cat pod-with-resources.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-resources
spec:
  containers:
  - capabilities: {}
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/serve_hostname
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: kubernetes-serve-hostname
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 6Mi
    securityContext:
      capabilities: {}
      privileged: false
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
```

Applying a Project Quota
-----------------------------------------
Administrators may want to restrict how much of the cluster resources a given project may consume across
all of its pods.  To do this, an administrator applies a quota to a project.  A quota lets the
administrator set hard limits on the total amount of node resources (cpu, memory) and
API resources (pods, services, etc.) that a project may require.

Let's create a simple project that applies a basic quota where the total cpu usage across all pods cannot exceed 1 core and may not consume more than 750Mi of memory.

```shell
$ oc adm new-project quota-demo --admin=test-admin
$ oc project quota-demo
$ oc create quota quota --hard=cpu=1,memory=750Mi,pods=10,replicationcontrollers=10,resourcequotas=1,services=1
```

A few moments after the quota is created, the current usage in the project is calculated.

You can view the current usage by doing the following:

```
$ oc describe project quota-demo
Name:           quota-demo
Created:        4 hours ago

                Name:                   quota
                Resource                Used    Hard
                --------                ----    ----
                cpu                     0       1
                memory                  0       750Mi
                pods                    0       10
                replicationcontrollers  0       10
                resourcequotas          1       1
                services                0       10
Resource limits:  <none>        
```

Applying default resource limits
-----------------------------------------
Pod authors rarely specify resource limits for their pods.  As noted earlier, this is problematic because
it means a pod can consume as much resource on a node as is available.

Since we applied a quota to our project, let's see what happens when an end-user creates a pod that has unbounded
cpu and memory.

```shell
$ cat pod-without-resources.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: pod-without-resources
spec:
  containers:
  - capabilities: {}
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/serve_hostname
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: kubernetes-serve-hostname
    resources: {}
    securityContext:
      capabilities: {}
      privileged: false
    terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {} 
$ oc create -f pod-without-resources.yaml
Error from server: error when creating "pod-without-resources.yaml": pods "pod-without-resources" is forbidden: Failed quota: quota: must specify cpu,memory
```

The administrator is happy because end-users need to specify resource limits.

The end-user is miserable because they now need to set explicit resource values, and this is more work.

To make things better, the administrator can set some project wide defaults for resource constraints.

In addition, the administrator can set some limits to the basic shape of a pod and its container to ensure
pods can best fit the available node profile.  For example, while a project may be allowed to request 750Mi of
memory across all containers, the administrator may want to limit the amount of memory a single pod can consume
to 500Mi.  This type of flexibility allows administrators to set min/max limits for cpu and memory constraints
at a pod or container level to fit the nodes that are in the cluster.  After all, if a user can use 20 cpus,
but the largest node in your cluster is 4 cpus, you don't really want user's to build pods that request 8 cpus.

It's best to reject those types of pods up front.

So let's set some default limits for this project:

```shell
$ cat limits.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: limits
spec:
  limits:
  - max:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 750Mi
    min:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 5Mi
    type: Pod
  - default:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 100Mi
    max:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 750Mi
    min:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 5Mi
    type: Container
$ oc create -f limits.yaml
$ oc describe project quota-demo
Name:           quota-demo
Created:        4 hours ago

        memory                  0       750Mi
        pods                    0       10
        replicationcontrollers  0       10
        resourcequotas          1       1
        services                0       10
Resource limits:
        Name:           limits
        Type            Resource        Min     Max     Default
        ----            --------        ---     ---     ---
        Pod             cpu             10m     500m    -
        Pod             memory          5Mi     750Mi   -
        Container       cpu             10m     500m    100m
        Container       memory          5Mi     750Mi   100Mi  
```

You can now see that the project has set min/max limits at the pod and container scopes.

If a pod is created that has no cpu resource limit set, the default (100m) will be set as an explicit limit.  Similarly, if a pod is created that has no memory resource limit set, the default (100Mi) will be set as an explicit limit.

To demonstrate this, let's try to create the pod that failed previously:

```shell
$ oc create -f pod-without-resources.yaml
$ oc describe project quota-demo
Name:           quota-demo
Created:        4 hours ago

        cpu                     100m    1
        memory                  100Mi   750Mi
        pods                    1       10
        replicationcontrollers  0       10
        resourcequotas          1       1
        services                0       10
Resource limits:
        Name:           limits
        Type            Resource        Min     Max     Default
        ----            --------        ---     ---     ---
        Pod             cpu             10m     500m    -
        Pod             memory          5Mi     750Mi   -
        Container       cpu             10m     500m    100m
        Container       memory          5Mi     750Mi   100Mi    
```

As you can see, we now have a single pod in our project, and that pod is consuming the default amount of resources.

Templates: Parameterized resources
-----------------------------------------
Templates allow project editors to quickly add content to the project from pre-defined content.

Pods that are created from template content will use any of the specified resource defaults that we had
previously defined in our project, but as a template author, it is possible to actually expose memory
and cpu consumption as parameters in your template.

To demonstrate this, let's provision a custom template that enumerates resources:

```shell
$ oc create -f application-template-with-resources.json
$ oc describe template ruby-helloworld-sample-with-resources
Name:           ruby-helloworld-sample-with-resources

Object Labels:  template=application-template-stibuild

Objects:
    Service     frontend
    Route       route-edge
    ImageStream origin-ruby-sample
    ImageStream ruby-20-centos7


    Service     database           
```

Notice that the template exposes parameters to limit the amount of memory and cpu used by the pods in your project.

* MYSQL_RESOURCES_LIMITS_CPU - the amount of cpu for your mysql containers
* MYSQL_RESOURCES_LIMITS_MEMORY - the amount of memory for your mysql containers
* FRONTEND_RESOURCES_LIMITS_CPU - the amount of cpu for your frontend containers
* FRONTEND_RESOURCES_LIMITS_MEMORY - the amount of memory for your frontend containers

When you build your source code, OpenShift will create pods to execute the build in your project.  Those pods consume
node resources, so they are subject to quota.  It is possible to customize the amount of cpu and memory used by
a build.  Notice that the template exposes the following parameters to tailor the amount of resources per build.

* BUILD_RUBY_RESOURCES_LIMITS_MEMORY - the amount of memory used when running builds of your ruby code
* BUILD_RUBY_RESOURCES_LIMITS_CPU - the amount of cpu used when running builds of your ruby code

Finally, when you deploy new versions of your code, OpenShift will create pods to execute the deployment.  Those
pods consume node resources, so they are subject to quota.  Like builds, you can customize the amount of resources
you give to a deployment task:

* DEPLOY_FRONTEND_RESOURCES_LIMITS_MEMORY - the amount of memory used when deploying new versions of your frontend
* DEPLOY_FRONTEND_RESOURCES_LIMITS_CPU - the amount of cpu used when deploying new versions of your frontend
* DEPLOY_MYSQL_RESOURCES_LIMITS_MEMORY - the amount of memory used when deploying new versions of your database
* DEPLOY_MYSQL_RESOURCES_LIMITS_CPU - the amount of cpu used when deploying new versions of your database

Putting it all together
---------------------------------------
Now that we have created our template, let's create the content within it.

```shell
$ oc process ruby-helloworld-sample-with-resources | oc create -f -
service "frontend" created
route "route-edge" created
imagestream "origin-ruby-sample" created
imagestream "ruby-20-centos7" created
buildconfig "ruby-sample-build" created
deploymentconfig "frontend" created
service "database" created
deploymentconfig "database" created
```

Every action in the project that consumes node level cpu or memory resources has defined limits.

If you kick off builds, or execute deployments, you will see that those pods have defined resource limits that are derived from their associated configuration.  All of these actions are therefore
tracked in the project quota.

To demonstrate this, let's show what happens when you run at the limit of quota.

Let's kick off a number of builds to see what happens when we exceed quota.

```shell
$ oc start-build ruby-sample-build
$ ... [repeat until exceeded quota] ...
```

Let's assume our 5th build exceeded quota:

```
$ oc describe builds ruby-sample-build-5
Name:     ruby-sample-build-5

```

Note the event that was published from the build controller to denote that there is no more quota
available in the project to execute the build.

Once the other builds complete, and build pods complete, quota will be released, and eventually your
build will schedule a pod and complete.

Summary
----------------------------
Actions that consume node resources for cpu and memory can be subject to hard quota limits defined
by the administrator.

Any action that consumes those resources can be tweaked, or can pick up project level defaults to
meet your end goal.
