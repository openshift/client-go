# This is the official OpenShift Origin image. It has as its entrypoint the OpenShift
# all-in-one binary.
#
# While this image can be used for a simple node it does not support OVS based
# SDN or storage plugins required for EBS, GCE, Gluster, Ceph, or iSCSI volume
# management. For those features please use 'openshift/node'
#
# The standard name for this image is openshift/origin
