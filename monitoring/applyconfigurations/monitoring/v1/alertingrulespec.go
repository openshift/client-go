	// share a configured evaluation interval.  All rules in the group will be
	// processed together on this interval, sequentially, and all rules will be
	// processed.

	// It's common to group related alerting rules into a single AlertingRule
	// resources, and within that resource, closely related alerts, or simply
	// alerts with the same interval, into individual groups.  You are also free
	// to create AlertingRule resources with only a single rule group, but be
	// aware that this can have a performance impact on Prometheus if the group is
	// extremely large or has very complex query expressions to evaluate.
	// Spreading very complex rules across multiple groups to allow them to be
	// processed in parallel is also a common use-case.
